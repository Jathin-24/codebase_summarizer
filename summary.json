  "project_summary": "This project represents the front-end components of a basic web application designed to serve as a user interface for a calculator. It provides the visual structure and styling but currently lacks the underlying interactive logic.\n\n**Overall Purpose:**\nThe primary purpose of this project is to establish the user-facing interface for a calculator. It defines the layout, display area, and interactive buttons, making it ready to accept user input and display results, though the core functionality is not yet present.\n\n**Main Components:**\n\n*   **`index.html`**: This is the structural foundation of the web page. It defines a text input field for display and a grid of 20 buttons, which include numbers, operators, and control functions like \"AC\" and \"del\". Many buttons are configured with `onclick` attributes to trigger intended JavaScript functions like `clearDisplay()` and `addToDisplay()`.\n*   **`style.css`**: This file provides the visual presentation and styling. It defines a universal reset, sets basic dimensions for the `html` and `body`, and styles the calculator's button grid (`.keys`) and individual buttons (making them circular, setting font sizes, colors, and layout).\n*   **`script.js`**: This file is currently empty. While `index.html` specifies intended JavaScript interactions (e.g., calling `clearDisplay()` or `addToDisplay()` on button clicks), the actual JavaScript logic to handle these events and perform any calculator operations is not yet implemented here.\n\n**Typical Workflow:**\n\n1.  **Entrypoint:** A user would access the `index.html` file in a web browser.\n2.  **User Interaction (Intended):** The user would see a calculator-like interface with a display input and a grid of buttons. They would interact by clicking these buttons.\n3.  **Flow (Currently Inactive):**\n    *   Clicking buttons like \"AC\", numbers (0-9), and operators (`%`, `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`, `.`, \"del\") is intended to invoke JavaScript functions like `clearDisplay()` and `addToDisplay()`.\n    *   Buttons labeled \"( )\" and \"=\" do not currently have `onclick` attributes defined in the HTML.\n    *   As `script.js` is empty, none of these intended JavaScript interactions will actually occur or have any effect on the display or calculator state. The project is awaiting the implementation of this core logic.\n\n**Notable Architectural Patterns:**\nThe project employs a standard client-side web architecture with a clear separation of concerns:\n*   **Structure (HTML):** `index.html` defines the content and layout.\n*   **Presentation (CSS):** `style.css` dictates the visual styling.\n*   **Behavior (JavaScript):** `script.js` is intended to handle the interactive logic, though it is currently unimplemented.\n\nThe use of `onclick` attributes directly in the HTML indicates an event-driven interaction model, where user actions on specific UI elements are meant to trigger corresponding JavaScript functions.",

    "index.html": "This HTML file sets up a basic web page structure.\n\n**Document Structure:**\n*   It's a standard HTML5 document with an English language declaration.\n*   The page title is \"Document\".\n*   It links to an external stylesheet named `style.css`.\n*   It includes an external JavaScript file named `script.js` at the end of the `body`.\n\n**Content:**\n*   The main content is contained within a `div` element with the class `container`.\n*   Inside this container, there is a text input field with the ID `i/p_area`.\n*   Below the input, there is another `div` with the class `keys`, which contains 20 `<button>` elements.\n*   Many buttons are configured with `onclick` attributes to call JavaScript functions:\n    *   `clearDisplay()` is called by a button labeled \"AC\".\n    *   `addToDisplay()` is called by buttons for numbers (0-9), mathematical operators (`%`, `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`, `.`), and \"del\".\n*   Buttons labeled \"( )\" and \"=\" do not have an `onclick` attribute defined in this HTML.",

    "style.css": "The `style.css` file defines basic styling for a web page.\n\nIt includes:\n*   A universal reset that sets `margin` and `padding` to 0, and `box-sizing` to `border-box` for all elements.\n*   `html` and `body` elements are set to occupy 100% of the viewport's `width` and `height`.\n*   The `.keys` class is styled as a grid container with four 100px wide columns, a 10px gap between items, no border, a dark semi-transparent background color, `fit-content` width, 10px `border-radius`, and 20px `padding`.\n*   All `button` elements are styled to be 100px by 100px, circular (`border-radius: 50%`), with a large, bold font (`font-size: 35px`, `font-weight: bolder`), no border, a dark semi-transparent background color, and white text color."
